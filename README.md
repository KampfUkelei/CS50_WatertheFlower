# CS50_WatertheFlower
Scratch Game for the Problem Set 0 of CS50 

The Goal of this game is to get as many Score Points as possibly. You achieve this by watering the flower until it blooms and then picking it before it withers. You lose one of 3 lifes when you water the flower for too long and let it wither. Once a certain Score is reached the flower starts moving. Later on the cloud disappears and the flower gets faster and faster. On top of that the waterdrops and the speed of them increases regulary.
